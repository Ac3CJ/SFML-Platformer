# Platformer Game - Electrical Circuits Theme

## Overview
This is a work-in-progress platformer game developed in C++ using SFML. The game is in its early concept design phase and is based on the theme of electrical circuits. The gameplay style is inspired by *Speedrunner's* and *Dead Cells*, focusing on fast-paced platforming action and circuit-themed mechanics.

## Features
- **Electrical Circuits Theme**: The game world and mechanics are inspired by electrical circuits, with levels and obstacles reflecting circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and wires.
- **Gameplay Style**: The game features a fast-paced platformer style similar to *Speedrunner's* and *Dead Cells*, with an emphasis on fluid movement and quick reflexes.
- **Procedurally Generated Levels**: (Planned) Randomized levels that will provide varied gameplay experiences each time you play.
- **Combat and Power-ups**: (Planned) Power-ups related to electrical components that enhance the player's abilities.

## Requirements
- C++17 or higher
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics and input handling
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ac3CJ/SFML-Platformer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SFML-Platformer
   ```

3. Compile the project using the provided Makefile:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Run the compiled game:
   ```bash
   ./platformer_game
   ```

## Gameplay
- The player controls a character navigating through levels filled with obstacles and enemies based on electrical components.
- The objective is to complete each level by reaching the goal while avoiding hazards and solving circuit-themed puzzles.
- The game will feature various power-ups that enhance abilities, as well as unique enemies based on electrical elements.

## Future Features
- **Procedurally Generated Levels**: A system for generating random levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Boss Battles**: Electrical-themed bosses that challenge the player with unique mechanics.
- **Story and Progression**: A narrative that ties the levels and gameplay together.
- **Enhanced Combat System**: A combat system based on electricity-based attacks.
